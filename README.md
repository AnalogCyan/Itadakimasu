Itadakimasu is a fun recipe password generator, based on the concept from the [Random but Memorable](https://randombutmemorable.simplecast.com/episodes/nice-security-hollywood-terror-VPL7w0_R) podcast. The generator creates unique, easy-to-remember passwords that double as questionable-quality recipes.

## Disclaimer

Itadakimasu is a fun project, not intended for serious use. We do not recommend using this as your primary password generator, as it may not provide the same level of security as dedicated password managers. Additionally, we cannot guarantee the quality or safety of the recipes generated by the app.
