Itadakimasu is a fun recipe password generator, based on the concept from the [Random but Memorable](https://randombutmemorable.simplecast.com/episodes/nice-security-hollywood-terror-VPL7w0_R) podcast. The generator creates unique, easy-to-remember passwords that double as questionable-quality recipes.

The app is available as an installable Progressive Web App (PWA), on the Google Play Store, and the Microsoft Store.
